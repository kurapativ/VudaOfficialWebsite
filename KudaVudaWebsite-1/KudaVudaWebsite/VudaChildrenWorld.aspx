That's what the newly formed VUDA Children's Club is trying to do. It's the one place you'll find no assignments, no rules, no restrictions but tons and tons of fun. A right place to be your self. After all, all work and no play makes.....!!!</p>

      <p>There are two ways of looking at children. Seeing them as monsters of evil who must be beaten into submission or as little two-legged walking computers who can be programmed into geniuses. Their view of the world their powers and abilities and their skills has become an observation aspect of every home. In short, children have a style of learning that fits their condition. They don’t need to be made to learn, told what to learn or shown how to learn. Learning for them is as natural as breathing! <br />
        <br />
        Visakhapatnam Urban development Authority (VUDA) takes a big step forward to understanding children better. The new Children's Club at the VUDA Children's World, would soon be the talk of the town in the direction of childcare. The right place where children can grow, not just in size, not even in knowledge but in curiosity, courage, confidence, independence, patience, competence, understanding and resourcefulness. Vizag kids, definitely deserve a place of their own to unleash their talents to fulfill their limitless ambitions.<br />
        <br />
        Come, be part of VUDA’s earnest endeavor to give children access to enough of the world. And to help them to take a better path into that world than anyone could ever make for them.</p>
